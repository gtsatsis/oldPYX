<body>
<p>The information on this page applies only to Pretend You're Xyzzy servers running under the
<a href="//pretendyoure.xyz/zy">pretendyoure.xzy/zy domain</a>. Other servers may have other logging
policies.</p>
<h1>Temporary logs</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of temporary logs.</p>
<h2>Server monitoring logs</h2>
<p>Logs which contain your chosen user name and IP address (and, on rare occasion, things you say in
chat) are collected and kept for a period of a few weeks, to assist with monitoring the server.
These logs are not willingly shared with third parties, and to date have not been shared with third
parties.</p>
<h2>Automatic moderation logs</h2>
<p>If the automatic moderating software takes action against you, your user name, IP address, and
the chat message that triggered said action are logged. These logs are retained for approximately
one month for evaluating the performance of the automatic moderation. These logs are not willingly
shared with third parties, and to date have not been shared with third parties. <strong>You may not
be informed that the automatic moderating software has taken action against you.</strong></p>
<h1>Permanent logs</h1>
<p>Game play details are kept on a permanent basis, to analyze which cards are the most and least
popular. The data in these logs may be made publicly available once an interface is completed, and
may be shared with third parties. These logs will never contain directly personally identifiable
information, however they do connect cards played in multiple rounds and games to you, and include
geographic information no more precise than your postal (ZIP) code (and may be incredibly
inaccurate). Additionally, unless you opt-out on the Preferences tab, your card play history will be
tracked between multiple sessions.</p>
<p>These data points are collected when you connect to a game server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A temporary ID to correlate all cards you play during a session.</li>
  <li>A persistent ID to correlate your activity between different sessions. Opting-out in the
  Preferences tab will prevent this ID from being saved between sessions.</li>
  <li>Your rough geographic location, including city, state/province/territory, country, and postal
  code, to some degree of accuracy.</li>
  <li>Information about your web browser including its name (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and current
  language (English, etc.).</li>
  <li>Information about your device including its operating system (Windows, Android, etc.) and type
  (phone, tablet, PC, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At no point is your IP address, chosen user name, or chat shared with anyone for any
purpose. Fill-in-the-blank card text is, however, logged and shared.</strong></p>
<h1>Google Analytics</h1>
<p>Yeah, who doesn't use that these days? I honestly don't look at it very often. It's cool to see
where people are getting linked to this from. You can block it if you really want to, but I'd prefer
you didn't.</p>
