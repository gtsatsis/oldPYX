  This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay
  very much. To assist with development, <strong>all traffic on this server <em>may</em> be
  logged.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The name you enter and your computer's IP address will <strong>always</strong> be logged when you
  load the game client. Chat and gameplay may also be logged.
